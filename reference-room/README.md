Here you should be able to find everything you need to know to reference.
Should you think something is missing, [please let me know](mailto:angelinurs@hotmail.com).
Should you discover a mistake in the docs (or a bug in general) feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack/issues) on GitHub.

While this page tries to be beginner-friendly, as someone who is interested in IT and curious.
